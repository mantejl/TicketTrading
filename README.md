# TicketTrading

Java program that replicates a ticket trading system. It reads artist and tour information from a JSON file, ticket trade details from a CSV file, and executes transactions based on a specified schedule. The code uses locks and semaphores to ensure proper agent scheduling and prints transaction details, updating the account balance after each successful trade. The program asks for an initial balance, and outputs a completion message, indicating a successful trades or the number of rejected trades.
